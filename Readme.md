## My Final_bootcamp project


Project description

Welcome to our data analysis project! Our objective is to analyze the data of our company in order to understand its current situation as well as predict the price of motorbikes.

To achieve this, we began by cleaning and exploring the data. We took a closer look at various factors that could potentially affect the price of motorbikes, including the power of the bike, the age of the bike, the distance it has been driven, the city where it is located, and the model of the motorbike.

After analyzing the data, we discovered that the most significant factor influencing the price of the bike is its power. While other factors did have an impact, they were not as significant.

To better understand and visualize the data, we created various graphs and charts, which helped us to clearly see the relationships between the different factors and the price of the bikes.

We then utilized various features, including age, power, and distance driven, to predict future prices of the motorbikes. Our best model for predicting the future price was the random forest model, which accurately predicted 87% of the outcomes using R squared.

By analyzing the data and utilizing advanced statistical models, we were able to gain valuable insights into the factors that influence the price of motorbikes, and predict future prices with a high degree of accuracy. We hope that these insights will help us make informed decisions about our business in the future.performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
